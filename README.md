Household Economic Effects on Child Maltreatment Allegation Rates in Texas 2022

Question: What is the median household income per county in TX?

In the fiscal year 2022, we utilized census data to determine county median incomes in Texas. Opting for the median due to skewed data, we encountered a limitation, analyzing 51 counties out of the state's 250+. A bar graph illustrated the income distribution, revealing that 30% exceeded $80,000, 45% ranged from $60,000 to $80,000, and 25% were at $60,000 or below. A subsequent line graph showcased economic trends. Key findings included a maximum income of $123,767 in Rockwall County, a median of $68,706 in Harris County, and a minimum of $33,871 in Starr County.

Question: What are the common types of maltreatment allegations per county in TX?

The three most common child abuse and neglect allegations in all counties in Texas in 2022 are 1.Neglectful Supervision 2.Physical Abuse 3.Sexual abuse. The bar graph displays the total count of the most common allegations,Neglectful Supervision, for each county. The visualization shows that Guadalupe county had the highest number of Neglectful Supervision allegations. 

Question:  Does household income affect type of cases?

Of all allegation types reported, Emotional Abuse had the highest correlation with median income (r = 0.070), & Abandonment had the lowest (r = 0.001). Median household income of a given county had little to no bearing on the types of allegations reported.

Question: Does household income affect number of cases?

From our analysis, we didn't see a strong correlation between household income and number of cases to suggest that there's a strong chance lower household income may lead to a higher number of cases. The highest number of cases were found in Harris county, and other counties that had a comparatively higher amount of cases were towards the lower income threshold. However, the scatterplot did not suggest a strong correlation for us to confirm the said relationship.
