Median Income per County Analysis

In the fiscal year 2022, we utilized census data to determine county median incomes in Texas. Opting for the median due to skewed data, we encountered a limitation, analyzing 51 counties out of the state's 250+. A bar graph illustrated the income distribution, revealing that 30% exceeded $80,000, 45% ranged from $60,000 to $80,000, and 25% were at $60,000 or below. A subsequent line graph showcased economic trends. Key findings included a maximum income of $123,767 in Rockwall County, a median of $68,706 in Harris County, and a minimum of $33,871 in Starr County.
